# Songer

here is a songs application :
- when you run it you will have the home page
- if you put in the route `/hello` it will render a page with hello world
- if you put `/capitalize` and put a text after it, it will capitalize the text you entered 
- if the route `/album` it will render a page with the albums

- if you put `/form` you will have a form and the user can enter an album it will be stored in the database and after the user submits it will render all the albums that we have
